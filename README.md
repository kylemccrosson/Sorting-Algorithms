# Sorting-Algorithms

Comparison of bubble sort and merge sort

This is a simple program with a main function that will sort a list of numbers using BubbleSort and MergeSort, and then tell you how many comparisons it took for each algorithm to sort the list.

The function takes input as a single line of integers separated only by commas (no spaces).
The program will first output the correctly ordered list of numbers, followed by how many comparisons it took for bubbleSort to work, then how many comparisons it took mergesort to work.
